                    Steven Paul Jobs, co-founder, chief executive, and chairman of Apple Computer, was an American inventor, designer, and entrepreneur. Apple's ground-breaking products, such as the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, are now widely seen as directing the course of modern technology.

                    Jobs, who was born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin graduate students who put him up for adoption, was bright but aimless, dropping out of college and dabbling in several fields before co-founding Apple with Steve Wozniak in 1976. Jobs left Apple in 1985 to found Pixar Animation Studios, before returning to the company more than a decade later. Jobs died of pancreatic cancer in 2011 after a long fight.
